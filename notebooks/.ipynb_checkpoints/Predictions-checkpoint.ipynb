      "1 The 1619 Project: A New Origin Story \"A dramatic expansion of a groundbreaking work of journalism  The 1619 Project: A New Origin Story offers a profoundly revealing vision of the American past and present. In late August 1619  a ship arrived in the British colony of Virginia bearing a cargo of twenty to thirty enslaved people from Africa. Their arrival led to the barbaric and unprecedented system of American chattel slavery that would last for the next 250 years. This is sometimes referred to as the country’s original sin  but it is more than that: It is the source of so much that still defines the United States. The New York Times Magazine’s award-winning “1619 Project” issue reframed our understanding of American history by placing slavery and its continuing legacy at the center of our national narrative. This new book substantially expands on that work  weaving together eighteen essays that explore the legacy of slavery in present-day America with thirty-six poems and works of fiction that illuminate key moments of oppression  struggle  and resistance. The essays show how the inheritance of 1619 reaches into every part of contemporary American society  from politics  music  diet  traffic  and citizenship to capitalism  religion  and our democracy itself. This is a book that speaks directly to our current moment  contextualizing the systems of race and caste within which we operate today. It reveals long-glossed-over truths around our nation’s founding and construction—and the way that the legacy of slavery did not end with emancipation  but continues to shape contemporary American life.\"\n",

      "2 \"The Real Anthony Fauci: Bill Gates  Big Pharma  and the Global War on Democracy and Public Health (Children’s Health Defense)\" \"Pharma-funded mainstream media has convinced millions of Americans that Dr. Anthony Fauci is a hero. He is anything but. As director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)  Dr. Anthony Fauci dispenses $6.1 billion in annual taxpayer-provided funding for scientific research  allowing him to dictate the subject  content  and outcome of scientific health research across the globe. Fauci uses the financial clout at his disposal to wield extraordinary influence over hospitals  universities  journals  and thousands of influential doctors and scientists—whose careers and institutions he has the power to ruin  advance  or reward. During more than a year of painstaking and meticulous research  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unearthed a shocking story that obliterates media spin on Dr. Fauci . . . and that will alarm every American—Democrat or Republican—who cares about democracy  our Constitution  and the future of our children’s health. The Real Anthony Fauci reveals how “America’s Doctor” launched his career during the early AIDS crisis by partnering with pharmaceutical companies to sabotage safe and effective off-patent therapeutic treatments for AIDS. Fauci orchestrated fraudulent studies  and then pressured US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulators into approving a deadly chemotherapy treatment he had good reason to know was worthless against AIDS. Fauci repeatedly violated federal laws to allow his Pharma partners to use impoverished and dark-skinned children as lab rats in deadly experiments with toxic AIDS and cancer chemotherapies. In early 2000  Fauci shook hands with Bill Gates in the library of Gates’ $147 million Seattle mansion  cementing a partnership that would aim to control an increasingly profitable $60 billion global vaccine enterprise with unlimited growth potential. Through funding leverage and carefully cultivated personal relationships with heads of state and leading media and social media institutions  the Pharma-Fauci-Gates alliance exercises dominion over global health policy. The Real Anthony Fauci details how Fauci  Gates  and their cohorts use their control of media outlets  scientific journals  key government and quasi-governmental agencies  global intelligence agencies  and influential scientists and physicians to flood the public with fearful propaganda about COVID-19 virulence and pathogenesis  and to muzzle debate and ruthlessly censor dissent.\"\n",

An ultimately heartwarming read  Will provides a humane glimpse of the man behind the actor  producer and musician  as he bares all his insecurities and trauma.” —USA Today One of the most dynamic and globally recognized entertainment forces of our time opens up fully about his life  in a brave and inspiring book that traces his learning curve to a place where outer success  inner happiness  and human connection are aligned. Along the way  Will tells the story in full of one of the most amazing rides through the worlds of music and film that anyone has ever had. Will Smith’s transformation from a West Philadelphia kid to one of the biggest rap stars of his era  and then one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood history  is an epic tale—but it’s only half the story. Will Smith thought  with good reason  that he had won at life: not only was his own success unparalleled  his whole family was at the pinnacle of the entertainment world. Only they didn't see it that way: they felt more like star performers in his circus  a seven-days-a-week job they hadn't signed up for. It turned out Will Smith's education wasn't nearly over. This memoir is the product of a profound journey of self-knowledge  a reckoning with all that your will can get you and all that it can leave behind. Written with the help of Mark Manson  author of the multi-million-copy bestseller The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck  Will is the story of how one person mastered his own emotions  written in a way that can help everyone else do the same. Few of us will know the pressure of performing on the world's biggest stages for the highest of stakes  but we can all understand that the fuel that works for one stage of our journey might have to be changed if we want to make it all the way home. The combination of genuine wisdom of universal value and a life story that is preposterously entertaining  even astonishing  puts Will the book  like its author  in a category by itself.\"\n",
